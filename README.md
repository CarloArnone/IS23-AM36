### Pills of Software
The Application we are going to develop is **MyShelfie** (by CranioGames). <br>
The game states in one main accomplishment to score more points of the opponent, you can score points in different ways but basically is like Connect Four style playing Grid, where you have to insert some placeholders to build your own shelf and obtain some configurations. <br>
